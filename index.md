# Heat Map of Oral Health in Tsimane Population

## Overview of the Visualization

This figure visually represents the oral health status of the Tsimane population.

Key features:

1. X-axis: Represents different teeth (incisors, canines, premolars, molars)
2. Y-axis: Represents age groups, ranging from 15-24 to 75+
3. Color coding: Indicates the health status of each tooth (healthy, superficial cavity, deep cavity, only root left, missing)
4. Separate panels: Shows data for men and women, and for upper and lower teeth

## Significance

1. **Comprehensive Data Representation**: 
   - Displays data for all 32 teeth across multiple age groups and both sexes
   - Allows for the visualization of over 10,000 data points in a single, coherent image

2. **Intuitive Pattern Recognition**:
   - Enables quick identification of patterns in tooth decay and loss across age groups
   - Facilitates easy comparison between upper and lower teeth, and between men and women

3. **Temporal Aspect**:
   - Effectively shows the progression of oral health issues with age
   - Allows for the identification of critical age ranges where interventions might be most effective

4. **Gender Comparison**:
   - Side-by-side presentation of male and female data allows for immediate gender-based comparisons
   - Highlights subtle differences in oral health patterns between sexes

5. **Tooth-Specific Insights**:
   - Provides detailed information on which specific teeth are most vulnerable to decay or loss
   - Allows for targeted recommendations based on tooth type and location
