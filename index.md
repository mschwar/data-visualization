## Project Summary

This figure presents a novel heatmap designed to visually represent the complete oral health status of the Tsimane population of the Bolivian Amazon. The primary challenge was to synthesize a massive, multidimensional dataset—over **32,000 individual data points** (1,176 participants × 28 teeth)—into a single, intuitive image. This visualization effectively communicates complex patterns of dental decay and tooth loss across age, sex, and anatomy.

## The Solution & Key Features

The solution is a multi-panel heatmap that organizes the data along several clear axes:

*   **Population:** Data is split into two main panels for **Men (n=543)** and **Women (n=633)**, allowing for immediate comparison.
*   **Anatomy:** Each panel is further divided into **Upper and Lower Teeth**, showing the distinct patterns of decay for the maxilla and mandible.
*   **Tooth Type (X-axis):** The horizontal axis represents all 28 permanent teeth (excluding third molars), grouped by type: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars.
*   **Individuals & Age (Y-axis):** Each horizontal line represents a single individual. Participants are sorted and grouped by age, from 15-24 to 75+, clearly illustrating the progression of oral health over a lifetime.
*   **Health Status (Color Scale):** A 5-point ordinal color scale indicates the health of each tooth, from **Healthy (blue)** to **Missing (dark red)**, providing an at-a-glance measure of disease severity.

## Key Insights & Significance

This visualization makes complex trends immediately apparent:

1.  **Unprecedented Data Density:** It successfully displays over 32,000 data points in one coherent image.
2.  **At-a-Glance Pattern Recognition:** The visual structure allows for rapid identification of key trends, such as molars showing the earliest decay and canine teeth demonstrating remarkable resilience.
3.  **Clear Progression Over the Lifespan:** The vertical sorting by age effectively creates a timeline, showing how oral health deteriorates from young adulthood into old age.
4.  **Direct Gender and Anatomical Comparison:** The side-by-side panel layout highlights that Tsimane women tend to experience more severe and earlier tooth loss than men.
5.  **Actionable, Tooth-Specific Insights:** The granular detail provides specific information on which teeth are most vulnerable, allowing for highly targeted preventative recommendations.
