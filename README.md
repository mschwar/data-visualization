# Tsimane Oral Health Heatmap: A Data Visualization Project

This repository showcases a data visualization project designed to represent the complete oral health status of the Tsimane population of Bolivia. The heatmap synthesizes over 32,000 data points from 1,176 individuals into a single, intuitive image, revealing complex patterns of dental health across age, sex, and anatomy.

## About the Visualization

The heatmap displays the dental health of **1,176 individuals** (543 men and 633 women) from the Tsimane Health and Life History Project. Its purpose is to make a complex, multidimensional dataset immediately understandable by visualizing patterns of tooth decay and loss across:
*   **28 permanent teeth** (incisors, canines, premolars, and molars)
*   **Age groups** (ranging from 15-24 to 75+)
*   **Sex** (male and female)
*   **Anatomy** (upper and lower teeth)

A 5-point color scale indicates the health status of each tooth, from healthy (blue) to missing (red).

## Repository Contents
